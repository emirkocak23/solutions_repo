# Problem 1

# üìò Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory


## üß† General Understanding (Applies to Both Options)

To analyze and simplify circuits using **graph theory**, we first need to understand how to **model an electrical circuit as a graph** and how classical rules like **series and parallel combinations** map onto this model.

### üîå Circuit as a Graph

A circuit can be represented as a **weighted undirected graph**:

- **Nodes (Vertices)**: Represent **electrical junctions** or connection points.
- **Edges**: Represent **resistors**, where the **edge weight** equals the resistance value $R$ in ohms $(\Omega)$.

#### üîπ Example Mapping:

| Circuit Element | Graph Element       | Notes                                  |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Junction         | Node $v_i$          | No resistance associated               |
| Resistor $R$     | Edge $e_{ij}$       | Connects nodes $v_i \leftrightarrow v_j$, with weight $R$ |

### üîÅ Series and Parallel in Graph Terms

#### üî∏ Series Connection:

---

- Two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are in **series** if:
  - They are connected end-to-end.
  - There is **no branching** at the middle junction.
  - In graph terms: a **node with degree 2** where both edges are resistors.

**Equivalent Resistance**:

$$
R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2
$$

#### üî∏ Parallel Connection:

---

- Two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are in **parallel** if:
  - Both ends of the resistors are connected to the **same pair of nodes**.
  - In graph terms: **multiple edges** between the same two nodes.

**Equivalent Resistance**:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
R_{eq} = \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)^{-1}
$$

### üß© Identifying Nested Series-Parallel Combinations

Nested combinations occur when series and parallel blocks are **combined hierarchically**, for example:

- A parallel block of resistors, each of which is itself a series of two resistors.
- A series of blocks, where each block is a parallel structure.

#### üîç Strategy to Simplify:

1. **Recursively identify** and reduce:
   - Lowest-level series groups.
   - Lowest-level parallel groups.
2. **Replace** each group with a single equivalent resistance.
3. Repeat until the entire circuit is reduced to a single equivalent resistor between the source and destination.

#### üõ† Tools for Detection:

- **Node Degree**:
  - Degree-2 nodes likely indicate series connections.
  - Multiple edges between nodes indicate parallel paths.

- **Graph Traversal**:
  - DFS/BFS can help trace paths and identify reducible structures.

# üìò Option 1: Simplified Task ‚Äì Algorithm Description

---

## üß† Conceptual Overview

To compute the **equivalent resistance** between two nodes in a circuit using **graph theory**, the goal is to reduce the graph by successively collapsing:

- **Series connections** into single equivalent resistors
- **Parallel connections** into a single equivalent resistor
- **Nested structures** recursively

The final output should be a single resistor representing the **total resistance** between the two terminals.

---

## üîç Key Concepts

### üî∏ Graph Representation

- Each **junction** is a **node** $v_i$
- Each **resistor** is an **edge** $e_{ij}$ with weight $R_{ij}$
- The full circuit is a graph $G = (V, E)$ with:
- $V$: set of nodes
- $E$: set of edges with resistance weights

---

### üî∏ Series Connection Detection

**Condition**: A node $v_k$ has exactly **two neighbors** $v_i$ and $v_j$, and:

- There is no other connection or branching at $v_k$
- Resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are connected as $v_i - R_1 - v_k - R_2 - v_j$

**Combine** into:

$$
R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2
$$

### üî∏ Parallel Connection Detection

**Condition**: Multiple edges between the same pair of nodes $(v_i, v_j)$:

- $e_{ij}^{(1)}, e_{ij}^{(2)}, \dots, e_{ij}^{(n)}$

**Combine** using:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{R_k}
$$

## üß© Handling Nested Configurations

Nested configurations are simplified by **recursively** applying the same logic:

- **Innermost groups** are simplified first.
- As reductions occur, new series or parallel patterns may emerge.
- These are detected again in the next iteration.

**Example**:  
A resistor network like `((R1 + R2) || (R3 + R4)) + R5` is handled by:

1. Reducing $R_1 + R_2$
2. Reducing $R_3 + R_4$
3. Applying parallel reduction
4. Adding $R_5$

---

## üîÄ Cycles and Branching

**Cycles** complicate the detection of series/parallel patterns.

- Basic series/parallel rules apply only to **acyclic subgraphs**
- For graphs with cycles:
  - Use **graph traversal algorithms** (DFS, BFS) to identify **simplifiable substructures**
  - Apply **loop transformation rules** like:
    - **Delta-Wye (Œî-Y) Transformations**
    - **Kirchhoff‚Äôs laws** in advanced versions

For now, this simplified algorithm **does not handle arbitrary cycles**; it's best suited for **series-parallel graphs**.
